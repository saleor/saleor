## What makes Saleor special?

- **Technology-agnostic** - no monolithic plugin architecture or technology lock-in.

- **GraphQL only** - Not afterthought API design or fragmentation across different styles of API.

- **Headless and API only** - APIs are the only way to interact, configure, or extend the backend.

- **Open source** -  a single version of Saleor without feature fragmentation or commercial limitations.

- **Cloud native** - battle tested on global brands.

- **Native-multichannel** - Per [channel](https://docs.saleor.io/docs/3.x/developer/channels) control of pricing, currencies, stock, product, and more.


## Why API-only Architecture?

Saleor's API-first extensibility provides powerful tools for developers to extend backend using [webhooks](https://docs.saleor.io/docs/3.x/developer/extending/webhooks/overview), attributes, [metadata](https://docs.saleor.io/docs/3.x/api-usage/metadata), [apps](https://docs.saleor.io/docs/3.x/developer/extending/apps/overview), [subscription queries](https://docs.saleor.io/docs/3.x/developer/extending/webhooks/subscription-webhook-payloads), [API extensions](https://docs.saleor.io/docs/3.x/developer/extending/webhooks/synchronous-events/overview), [dashboard iframes](https://docs.saleor.io/docs/3.x/developer/extending/apps/overview).

Compared to traditional plugin architectures (monoliths) it provides the following benefits:

* There is less downtime as apps are deployed independently.
* Reliability and performance - custom logic is separated from the core.
* Simplified upgrade paths - eliminates incompatibility conflicts between extensions.
* Technology-agnostic - works with any technology, stack, or language.
* Parallel development - easier to collaborate than with a monolithic core.
* Simplified debugging - easier to narrow down bugs in independent services.
* Scalability - extensions and apps can be scaled independently.

### What are the tradeoffs?
If you are a single developer working with a small business that doesn't have high traffic or a critical need for 24/7 availability, using a service-oriented approach might feel more complex compared to the traditional WordPress or Magento approach that provides a language-specific framework, runtime, database schema, aspect-oriented programming, and other tools to a quick start.

However, if you deploy on a daily basis, reliability and uptime is critical,
you need to collaborate with other developers, or you have non-trivial requirements you might be in the right place.

## Installation

[See the Saleor docs](https://docs.saleor.io/docs/3.x/developer/installation) for step-by-step installation and deployment instructions.

Note:
The `main` branch is the development version of Saleor and it may be unstable. To use the latest stable version, download it from the [Releases](https://github.com/saleor/saleor/releases/) page or switch to a release tag.

The current production-ready version is 3.x and you should use this version for all three components:

- Saleor: https://github.com/saleor/saleor/releases/
- Dashboard: https://github.com/saleor/saleor-dashboard/releases/
- Storefront: https://github.com/saleor/react-storefront/releases/

### Saleor Cloud

`npm i -g @saleor/cli`

and run the following command:

`saleor register`

Bootstrap your first [storefront](https://github.com/saleor/react-storefront) with:
