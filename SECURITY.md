## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities using a public GitHub issue. If you believe you've found a security issue, please contact our security mailing list:

security@getsaleor.com

You will be credited as the reporter once a fix is ready to be published. At this time we do not have a bounty program in place so we are not able to offer monetary rewards for any problems reported.
