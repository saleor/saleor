# Security Policy

> [!WARNING]
> DO NOT report security vulnerabilities using a public GitHub issue.

If you believe you've found a security issue, please contact us through one of the following methods:

- Using GitHub security advisories: https://github.com/saleor/saleor/security/advisories
- Alternatively, through our mailing list: security@saleor.io

Whichever method you choose, you will be credited as the reporter once the announcement is published.

## Guidelines

A report must include:

- A clear description of the issue
- Reproduction steps that allow us to verify the behavior
- Affected version(s) and environment details (versions, OS, tools, configurations)
- Let us know if you are willing to review the patches before their publication

Reports that lack these elements may be considered incomplete and may be closed without follow-up,
reports may also be closed if the submitter does not engage to follow-ups.

## Automated Reports

We do not accept:

- Low-effort or automatically generated reports (including AI-generated content)
- Reports that are bulk-submitted without context or verification
- Reports that are not addressing feedback or questions

## No Monetary Rewards

We do not have a bounty program in place, so we cannot offer monetary rewards for any reported problems.
