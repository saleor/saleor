    Inactivity is based on the "Checkout.last_change" datetime column.

    Deletes:
    - Anonymous checkouts after 30 days of inactivity no matter if it has lines or not,
      configurable through ``settings.ANONYMOUS_CHECKOUTS_TIMEDELTA``.
    - Users checkouts after 90 days of inactivity no matter if it has lines or not,
      configurable via``settings.USER_CHECKOUTS_TIMEDELTA``.
    - All anonymous and users checkouts after 6h of inactivity
      if there are no lines associated, refer to ``settings.EMPTY_CHECKOUTS_TIMEDELTA``.

    :param batch_size: The maximum row count that can be deleted per ``DELETE FROM``
        SQL statement. Around 13.5 KB of memory will be utilized by the Celery
        worker per row, thus 2000 will be using around 27 MB.
    :param batch_count: How many batches can be executed in a single task.
        This limits how long can the task run as there may be lots of checkouts
        to delete.
    :param invocation_count: How many times the task re-triggered itself up.
    :param invocation_limit: The maximum times the task can re-trigger itself up
        in order to limit how long it may run.

    :return: A tuple containing row count deleted (int)
             and whether there is more to delete (bool).
