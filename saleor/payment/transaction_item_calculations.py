    same type and psp reference and correctly increase the amounts.

    In case of having the event of type authorize_adjustment, any authorize
    events older than the `authorize_adjustment` will be skipped. The

    a given psp reference. In case of having a success or failure event for
    the same psp reference as the request event, it assumes that the requested
    amount has been already processed. The pending amount will not be increased.

    The transaction amount is increased when the success event exists. In case
    of having a failure event for the same psp reference, the creation time will
    be used to determine which event is newer. If the failure event is newer, the
