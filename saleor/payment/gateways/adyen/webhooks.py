    # The workaround for refund payments when something will crash in
    # `create_order` function before processing a payment.
    # At this moment we have a payment processed on Adyen side but we have to do
    # something more on Saleor side (ACTION_TO_CONFIRM), it's create an order in
    # this case, so before try to create the order we have to confirm the payment
    # and force change the flag to_confirm to True again.
    #
    # This is because we have to handle 2 flows:
    # 1. Having confirmed payment to refund easily when we can't create an order.
    # 2. Do not process payment again when `complete_checkout` logic will execute
    #    in `create_order` without errors. We just receive a processed transaction
    #    then.
    #
    # This fix is related to SALEOR-4777. PR #8471
