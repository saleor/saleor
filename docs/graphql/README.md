# Saleor GraphQL API Documentation

## Overview

Saleor provides a comprehensive GraphQL API that serves as the backbone for all e-commerce operations. This API is designed with an API-first approach, ensuring that all functionality is accessible through well-defined GraphQL operations.

## Quick Start

The Saleor GraphQL API is available at the `/graphql/` endpoint of your Saleor instance. You can explore the API using the built-in GraphQL Playground by navigating to `/graphql/` in your browser.
