Social Media Optimization (SMO)
===============================

Open Graph
----------

For more effective and efficient social media engagement, we've added `Open Graph Protocol<http://ogp.me/>`_ to the Homepage and all products/categories.

Open Graph meta tags allows to control what content shows up (description, title, url, photo, etc.) when page is shared on social media, turning your web page into a rich object in a social graph.
