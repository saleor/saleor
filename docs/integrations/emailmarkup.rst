Email Markup
============

Saleor is using schema.org markup to highlight the most important information within an email and allow users to easily interact with it.
`Order confirmation email <https://developers.google.com/gmail/markup/reference/order>`_ will be displayed as an interactive summary card.

Email Markup is enabled by default, however your customers won't see it until you `Register with Google <https://developers.google.com/gmail/markup/registering-with-google>`_
