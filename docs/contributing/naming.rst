Naming Conventions
==================

To keep a consistent code structure we follow some rules when naming files.


Python Modules
--------------

Try to have the name reflect the function of the file. If possible avoid generic file names such as ``utils.py``.


Django Templates
----------------

Use underscore as a word separator.


Static Files
------------

Use dashes to separate words as they end up as part of the URL.
