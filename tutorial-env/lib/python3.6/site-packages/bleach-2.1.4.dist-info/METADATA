Bleach is an allowed-list-based HTML sanitizing library that escapes or strips
markup and attributes.

Bleach can also linkify text safely, applying filters that Django's ``urlize``
filter cannot, and optionally setting ``rel`` attributes, even on links already
in the text.

Bleach is intended for sanitizing text from *untrusted* sources. If you find
yourself jumping through hoops to allow your site administrators to do lots of
things, you're probably outside the use cases. Either trust those users, or
don't.

Because it relies on html5lib_, Bleach is as good as modern browsers at dealing
with weird, quirky HTML fragments. And *any* of Bleach's methods will fix
unbalanced or mis-nested tags.

The version on GitHub_ is the most up-to-date and contains the latest bug
fixes. You can find full documentation on `ReadTheDocs`_.

Bleach changes
==============

Version 2.1.4 (August 16th, 2018)
---------------------------------

**Security fixes**

None

**Backwards incompatible changes**

* Dropped support for Python 3.3. (#328)

**Features**

None

**Bug fixes**

* Handle ambiguous ampersands in correctly. (#359)


Version 2.1.3 (March 5th, 2018)
-------------------------------

**Security fixes**

* Attributes that have URI values weren't properly sanitized if the
  values contained character entities. Using character entities, it
  was possible to construct a URI value with a scheme that was not
  allowed that would slide through unsanitized.

  This security issue was introduced in Bleach 2.1. Anyone using
  Bleach 2.1 is highly encouraged to upgrade.

  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1442745

**Backwards incompatible changes**

None

**Features**

None

**Bug fixes**

* Fixed some other edge cases for attribute URI value sanitizing and
  improved testing of this code.

**Bug fixes**

* ``bleach.clean()`` no longer unescapes entities including ones that are missing
  a ``;`` at the end which can happen in urls and other places. (#143)

* linkify: fix http links inside of mailto links; thank you, sedrubal! (#300)

* clarify security policy in docs (#303)

* fix dependency specification for html5lib 1.0b8, 1.0b9, and 1.0b10; thank you,
  Zoltán! (#268)

  thank you, Greg Guthe!


Version 2.0 (March 8th, 2017)
-----------------------------

**Security fixes**

* None


**Backwards incompatible changes**

* Removed support for Python 2.6. #206

* Removed support for Python 3.2. #224

* Bleach no longer supports html5lib < 0.99999999 (8 9s).

  This version is a rewrite to use the new sanitizing API since the old
  one was dropped in html5lib 0.99999999 (8 9s).

  If you're using 0.9999999 (7 9s) upgrade to 0.99999999 (8 9s) or higher.

  If you're using 1.0b8 (equivalent to 0.9999999 (7 9s)), upgrade to 1.0b9
  (equivalent to 0.99999999 (8 9s)) or higher.

* ``bleach.clean`` and friends were rewritten

  ``clean`` was reimplemented as an html5lib filter and happens at a different
  step in the HTML parsing -> traversing -> serializing process. Because of
  that, there are some differences in clean's output as compared with previous
  versions.

  Amongst other things, this version will add end tags even if the tag in
  question is to be escaped.

* ``bleach.clean`` and friends attribute callables now take three arguments:
  tag, attribute name and attribute value. Previously they only took attribute
  name and attribute value.

  All attribute callables will need to be updated.

* ``bleach.linkify`` was rewritten

  ``linkify`` was reimplemented as an html5lib Filter. As such, it no longer
  accepts a ``tokenizer`` argument.

  The callback functions for adjusting link attributes now takes a namespaced
  attribute.

  Previously you'd do something like this::

      def check_protocol(attrs, is_new):
          if not attrs.get('href', '').startswith('http:', 'https:')):
              return None
          return attrs

  Now it's more like this::

      def check_protocol(attrs, is_new):
          if not attrs.get((None, u'href'), u'').startswith(('http:', 'https:')):
              #            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
              return None
          return attrs

  Further, you need to make sure you're always using unicode values. If you
  don't then html5lib will raise an assertion error that the value is not
  unicode.

  All linkify filters will need to be updated.

* ``bleach.linkify`` and friends had a ``skip_pre`` argument--that's been
  replaced with a more general ``skip_tags`` argument.

  Before, you might do::

      bleach.linkify(some_text, skip_pre=True)

  The equivalent with Bleach 2.0 is::

      bleach.linkify(some_text, skip_tags=['pre'])

  You can skip other tags, too, like ``style`` or ``script`` or other places
  where you don't want linkification happening.

  All uses of linkify that use ``skip_pre`` will need to be updated.


**Changes**

* Supports Python 3.6.

* Supports html5lib >= 0.99999999 (8 9s).

* There's a ``bleach.sanitizer.Cleaner`` class that you can instantiate with your
  favorite clean settings for easy reuse.

* There's a ``bleach.linkifier.Linker`` class that you can instantiate with your
  favorite linkify settings for easy reuse.

* There's a ``bleach.linkifier.LinkifyFilter`` which is an htm5lib filter that
  you can pass as a filter to ``bleach.sanitizer.Cleaner`` allowing you to clean
  and linkify in one pass.

* ``bleach.clean`` and friends can now take a callable as an attributes arg value.

* Tons of bug fixes.

* Cleaned up tests.

* Documentation fixes.


Version 1.5 (November 4th, 2016)
--------------------------------

**Security fixes**

* None

**Backwards incompatible changes**

* clean: The list of ``ALLOWED_PROTOCOLS`` now defaults to http, https and
  mailto.

  Previously it was a long list of protocols something like ed2k, ftp, http,
  https, irc, mailto, news, gopher, nntp, telnet, webcal, xmpp, callto, feed,
  urn, aim, rsync, tag, ssh, sftp, rtsp, afs, data. #149

**Changes**

  Lorenz Schori! #219
