    """Computes greatest common divisor of two integers.

    Euclid's algorithm for the computation of the greatest
    common divisor  gcd(a, b)  of two (positive) integers
    a and b is based on the division identity
        a = q*b + r,
    where the quotient  q  and the remainder  r  are integers
    and  0 <= r < b. Then each common divisor of  a  and  b
    divides  r, and it follows that  gcd(a, b) == gcd(b, r).
    The algorithm works by constructing the sequence
    r0, r1, r2, ..., where  r0 = a, r1 = b,  and each  rn
    is the remainder from the division of the two preceding
    elements.

    In Python, q = a // b  and  r = a % b  are obtained by the
    floor division and the remainder operations, respectively.
    These are the most expensive arithmetic operations, especially
    for large  a  and  b.

    Lehmer's algorithm is based on the observation that the quotients
    qn = r(n-1) // rn  are in general small integers even
    when  a  and  b  are very large. Hence the quotients can be
    usually determined from a relatively small number of most
    significant bits.

    The efficiency of the algorithm is further enhanced by not
    computing each long remainder in Euclid's sequence. The remainders
    are linear combinations of  a  and  b  with integer coefficients
    derived from the quotients. The coefficients can be computed
    as far as the quotients can be determined from the chosen
    most significant parts of  a  and  b. Only then a new pair of
    consecutive remainders is computed and the algorithm starts
    anew with this pair.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import Float
    >>> Float(3.5)
    3.50000000000000
    >>> Float(3)
    3.00000000000000

    Creating Floats from strings (and Python ``int`` and ``long``
    types) will give a minimum precision of 15 digits, but the
    precision will automatically increase to capture all digits
    entered.

    >>> Float(1)
    1.00000000000000
    >>> Float(10**20)
    100000000000000000000.
    >>> Float('1e20')
    100000000000000000000.

    However, *floating-point* numbers (Python ``float`` types) retain
    only 15 digits of precision:

    >>> Float(1e20)
    1.00000000000000e+20
    >>> Float(1.23456789123456789)
    1.23456789123457

    It may be preferable to enter high-precision decimal numbers
    as strings:

    Float('1.23456789123456789')
    1.23456789123456789

    The desired number of digits can also be specified:

    >>> Float('1e-3', 3)
    0.00100
    >>> Float(100, 4)
    100.0

    Float can automatically count significant figures if a null string
    is sent for the precision; space are also allowed in the string. (Auto-
    counting is only allowed for strings, ints and longs).

    >>> Float('123 456 789 . 123 456', '')
    123456789.123456
    >>> Float('12e-3', '')
    0.012
    >>> Float(3, '')
    3.

    If a number is written in scientific notation, only the digits before the
    exponent are considered significant if a decimal appears, otherwise the
    "e" signifies only how to move the decimal:

    >>> Float('60.e2', '')  # 2 digits significant
    6.0e+3
    >>> Float('60e2', '')  # 4 digits significant
    6000.
    >>> Float('600e-2', '')  # 3 digits significant
    6.00

    Notes
    =====

    Floats are inexact by their nature unless their value is a binary-exact
    value.

    >>> approx, exact = Float(.1, 1), Float(.125, 1)

    For calculation purposes, evalf needs to be able to change the precision
    but this will not increase the accuracy of the inexact value. The
    following is the most accurate 5-digit approximation of a value of 0.1
    that had only 1 digit of precision:

    >>> approx.evalf(5)
    0.099609

    By contrast, 0.125 is exact in binary (as it is in base 10) and so it
    can be passed to Float or evalf to obtain an arbitrary precision with
    matching accuracy:

    >>> Float(exact, 5)
    0.12500
    >>> exact.evalf(20)
    0.12500000000000000000

    Trying to make a high-precision Float from a float is not disallowed,
    but one must keep in mind that the *underlying float* (not the apparent
    decimal value) is being obtained with high precision. For example, 0.3
    does not have a finite binary representation. The closest rational is
    the fraction 5404319552844595/2**54. So if you try to obtain a Float of
    0.3 to 20 digits of precision you will not see the same thing as 0.3
    followed by 19 zeros:

    >>> Float(0.3, 20)
    0.29999999999999998890

    If you want a 20-digit value of the decimal 0.3 (not the floating point
    approximation of 0.3) you should send the 0.3 as a string. The underlying
    representation is still binary but a higher precision than Python's float
    is used:

    >>> Float('0.3', 20)
    0.30000000000000000000

    Although you can increase the precision of an existing Float using Float
    it will not increase the accuracy -- the underlying value is not changed:

    >>> def show(f): # binary rep of Float
    ...     from sympy import Mul, Pow
    ...     s, m, e, b = f._mpf_
    ...     v = Mul(int(m), Pow(2, int(e), evaluate=False), evaluate=False)
    ...     print('%s at prec=%s' % (v, f._prec))
    ...
    >>> t = Float('0.3', 3)
    >>> show(t)
    4915/2**14 at prec=13
    >>> show(Float(t, 20)) # higher prec, not higher accuracy
    4915/2**14 at prec=70
    >>> show(Float(t, 2)) # lower prec
    307/2**10 at prec=10

    The same thing happens when evalf is used on a Float:

    >>> show(t.evalf(20))
    4915/2**14 at prec=70
    >>> show(t.evalf(2))
    307/2**10 at prec=10

    Finally, Floats can be instantiated with an mpf tuple (n, c, p) to
    produce the number (-1)**n*c*2**p:

    >>> n, c, p = 1, 5, 0
    >>> (-1)**n*c*2**p
    -5
    >>> Float((1, 5, 0))
    -5.00000000000000

    An actual mpf tuple also contains the number of bits in c as the last
    element of the tuple:

    >>> _._mpf_
    (1, 5, 0, 3)

    This is not needed for instantiation and is not the same thing as the
    precision. The mpf tuple and the precision are two separate quantities
    that Float tracks.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import Rational, nsimplify, S, pi
    >>> Rational(1, 2)
    1/2

    Rational is unprejudiced in accepting input. If a float is passed, the
    underlying value of the binary representation will be returned:

    >>> Rational(.5)
    1/2
    >>> Rational(.2)
    3602879701896397/18014398509481984

    If the simpler representation of the float is desired then consider
    limiting the denominator to the desired value or convert the float to
    a string (which is roughly equivalent to limiting the denominator to
    10**12):

    >>> Rational(str(.2))
    1/5
    >>> Rational(.2).limit_denominator(10**12)
    1/5

    An arbitrarily precise Rational is obtained when a string literal is
    passed:

    >>> Rational("1.23")
    123/100
    >>> Rational('1e-2')
    1/100
    >>> Rational(".1")
    1/10
    >>> Rational('1e-2/3.2')
    1/320

    The conversion of other types of strings can be handled by
    the sympify() function, and conversion of floats to expressions
    or simple fractions can be handled with nsimplify:

    >>> S('.[3]')  # repeating digits in brackets
    1/3
    >>> S('3**2/10')  # general expressions
    9/10
    >>> nsimplify(.3)  # numbers that have a simple form
    3/10

    But if the input does not reduce to a literal Rational, an error will
    be raised:

    >>> Rational(pi)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TypeError: invalid input: pi


    Low-level
    ---------

    Access numerator and denominator as .p and .q:

    >>> r = Rational(3, 4)
    >>> r
    3/4
    >>> r.p
    3
    >>> r.q
    4

    Note that p and q return integers (not SymPy Integers) so some care
    is needed when using them in expressions:

    >>> r.p/r.q
    0.75

        Tries to do some simplifications on self**expt

        When exponent is a fraction (so we have for example a square root),
        we try to find a simpler representation by factoring the argument
        up to factors of 2**15, e.g.

          - sqrt(4) becomes 2
          - sqrt(-4) becomes 2*I
          - (2**(3+7)*3**(6+7))**Rational(1,7) becomes 6*18**(3/7)

        Further simplification would require a special call to factorint on
        the argument which is not done here for sake of speed.

class Infinity(with_metaclass(Singleton, Number)):
    r"""Positive infinite quantity.

    In real analysis the symbol `\infty` denotes an unbounded
    limit: `x\to\infty` means that `x` grows without bound.

    Infinity is often used not only to define a limit but as a value
    in the affinely extended real number system.  Points labeled `+\infty`
    and `-\infty` can be added to the topological space of the real numbers,
    producing the two-point compactification of the real numbers.  Adding
    algebraic properties to this gives us the extended real numbers.

    Infinity is a singleton, and can be accessed by ``S.Infinity``,
    or can be imported as ``oo``.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import oo, exp, limit, Symbol
    >>> 1 + oo
    oo
    >>> 42/oo
    0
    >>> x = Symbol('x')
    >>> limit(exp(x), x, oo)

class NaN(with_metaclass(Singleton, Number)):
    """
    Not a Number.

    This serves as a place holder for numeric values that are indeterminate.
    Most operations on NaN, produce another NaN.  Most indeterminate forms,
    such as ``0/0`` or ``oo - oo` produce NaN.  Two exceptions are ``0**0``
    and ``oo**0``, which all produce ``1`` (this is consistent with Python's
    float).

    NaN is loosely related to floating point nan, which is defined in the
    IEEE 754 floating point standard, and corresponds to the Python
    ``float('nan')``.  Differences are noted below.

    NaN is mathematically not equal to anything else, even NaN itself.  This
    explains the initially counter-intuitive results with ``Eq`` and ``==`` in
    the examples below.

    NaN is not comparable so inequalities raise a TypeError.  This is in
    constrast with floating point nan where all inequalities are false.

    NaN is a singleton, and can be accessed by ``S.NaN``, or can be imported
    as ``nan``.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import nan, S, oo, Eq
    >>> nan is S.NaN
    True
    >>> oo - oo
    nan
    >>> nan + 1
    nan
    >>> Eq(nan, nan)   # mathematical equality
    False
    >>> nan == nan     # structural equality
    True
