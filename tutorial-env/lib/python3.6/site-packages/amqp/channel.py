                Exclusive queues may only be consumed from by the
                current connection. Setting the 'exclusive' flag
                always implies 'auto-delete'.

                RULE:

                    The server MUST support both exclusive (private)
                    and non-exclusive (shared) queues.

                RULE:

                    The server MUST raise a channel exception if
                    'exclusive' is specified and the queue already
                    exists and is owned by a different connection.

            auto_delete: boolean

                auto-delete queue when unused

                If set, the queue is deleted when all consumers have
                finished using it. Last consumer can be cancelled
                either explicitly or because its channel is closed. If
                there was no consumer ever on the queue, it won't be
                deleted.

                RULE:

                    The server SHOULD allow for a reasonable delay
                    between the point when it determines that a queue
                    is not being used (or no longer used), and the
                    point when it deletes the queue.  At the least it
                    must allow a client to create a queue and then
                    create a consumer to read from it, with a small
                    but non-zero delay between these two actions.  The
                    server should equally allow for clients that may
                    be disconnected prematurely, and wish to re-
                    consume from the same queue without losing
                    messages.  We would recommend a configurable
                    timeout, with a suitable default value being one
                    minute.

                RULE:

                    The server MUST ignore the auto-delete field if
                    the queue already exists.

            nowait: boolean

                do not send a reply method

                If set, the server will not respond to the method. The
                client should not wait for a reply method.  If the
                server could not complete the method it will raise a

                If this field is set the server does not expect

                functionality increases performance but at the cost of
                reliability.  Messages can get lost if a client dies
                before it can deliver them to the application.

            exclusive: boolean

                request exclusive access

                The client can request that messages be sent in

                message, the following message is already held

                prefetch size (and also falls into other prefetch

                messages.  This field may be used in combination with
                the prefetch-size field; a message will only be sent
