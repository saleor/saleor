The Django Debug Toolbar is a configurable set of panels that display various
debug information about the current request/response and when clicked, display
more details about the panel's content.

Here's a screenshot of the toolbar in action:

In addition to the built-in panels, a number of third-party panels are
contributed by the community.

The current version of the Debug Toolbar is 1.11. It works on Django ≥ 1.11.

Documentation, including installation and configuration instructions, is
available at https://django-debug-toolbar.readthedocs.io/.

The Django Debug Toolbar is released under the BSD license, like Django
itself. If you like it, please consider contributing!

The Django Debug Toolbar was originally created by Rob Hudson <rob@cogit8.org>
in August 2008 and was further developed by many contributors_.
