# Changelog

All notable, unreleased changes to this project will be documented in this file. For the released changes, please visit the [Releases](https://github.com/saleor/saleor/releases) page.

# 3.22.0

### Breaking changes
- The following changes were implemented to orders with a zero total amount:
  - No manual charge (`Transaction` or `Payment`) object will be created.
  - The `OrderEvents.ORDER_MARKED_AS_PAID` event will no longer be emitted.
- Logic associated with `WebhookEventAsyncType.CHECKOUT_FULLY_PAID` event will no longer be triggered when creating a transaction event from webhook response for checkouts with having total gross being 0. At the point of creating the transaction event checkout is already considered fully paid.
- Creating a Payment (old API) for a Checkout object with an existing Transaction (new API) is no longer permitted as it leads to inconsistent behavior.
- Webhooks are no longer triggered for deactivated Apps.

### GraphQL API

#### Data Modeling

> [!NOTE]
> Please note that Pages were renamed to Models (same Page types to Model types). This change was already made in Saleor Dashboard, but is not yet reflected in the API

- You can now filter and search Models (previously named "Pages") using the new `where` and `search` fields on the `pages` query.
  - The `where` argument supports `AND`/`OR` logic and explicit operators (`eq`, `oneOf`, `range`) for all fields.
  - Existing `filter` fields remain available in `where`: `ids`, `page_types` (now `page_type`), `slugs` (now `slug`), `metadata`.
  - New filtering options available only in `where`:
    - `attributes` - Filter by attributes associated with the page, including:
      - Filter by attribute slug and name
      - Filter by numeric attribute values (with `eq`, `oneOf`, `range` operators)
      - Filter by boolean attribute values
      - Filter by date and datetime attribute values
      - Filter by reference attributes to pages, products, product variants, categories, and collections (by IDs or slugs)
      - Support for `contains_all` (page must reference ALL specified objects) and `contains_any` (page must reference at least ONE specified object)
  - The `search` parameter is now a standalone argument (previously `filter.search`). It works the same as before, searching across page title, slug, and content.
- Extend `AttributeEntityType` with `CATEGORY` and `COLLECTION`. You can now assign categories and collections as an attribute reference.
- You can now filter and search attribute choices using the new `where` and `search` fields on the `attribute.choices` query.
  - The `where` argument supports explicit operators (`eq`, `oneOf`) for all fields.
  - Existing `filter` fields remain available in `where`: `ids`, `slugs` (now `slug`).
  - New filtering options available only in `where`:
    - `name` - Filter by attribute choice name.
  - The `search` parameter is now a standalone argument (previously `filter.search`), searching across attribute choice name and slug.
- Added new `SINGLE_REFERENCE` attribute type. You can now create a reference attribute that points to only one object (unlike the existing `REFERENCE` type, which supports multiple references). They can target the same entities as `REFERENCE` attributes (defined in the `AttributeEntityTypeEnum`).
- Extended support for filtering `products` by associated attributes in the `where` parameter:
  - **Attribute slug is now optional**: When filtering by attribute values, you no longer need to specify which attribute to search. This allows you to search across all attributes of a given type. This is especially useful for reference attributes when you want to find any product that references a specific object, regardless of which attribute contains that reference.
  - **Filter by reference attribute values**: Products can now be filtered by the objects they reference through `REFERENCE` and `SINGLE_REFERENCE` type attributes. You can filter by:
    - `referencedIds` - Global IDs of any referenced entity (Product, ProductVariant, Page, Category, Collection). Use this to search across multiple entity types in a single filter.
    - `productSlugs` - Slugs of referenced products
    - `productVariantSkus` - SKUs of referenced product variants
    - `pageSlugs` - Slugs of referenced pages
    - `categorySlugs` - Slugs of referenced categories
    - `collectionSlugs` - Slugs of referenced collections
  - **Two matching strategies** are available for all reference filters:
    - `containsAny` - Returns products that reference at least ONE of the specified objects (OR logic)
    - `containsAll` - Returns products that reference ALL of the specified objects (AND logic)
- Added support for filtering `productVariants` by associated attributes in the `where` parameter with the same capabilities as products (see details above):
  - **Attribute slug is optional**: Filter variants without specifying which attribute to search
  - **Filter by reference attributes**: All reference filtering options are available (`referencedIds`, `productSlugs`, `productVariantSkus`, `pageSlugs`, `categorySlugs`, `collectionSlugs`)
  - **Two matching strategies**: Use `containsAny` or `containsAll` operators
- You can now use the `AssignedAttribute` interface and the `assignedAttribute`, `assignedAttributes` fields on `Page`, `Product`, and `ProductVariant` to fetch assigned attributes and their values in a cleaner, more focused shape.
  - `attribute` and `attributes` fields on Page, Product, and ProductVariant are deprecated.
- Added `referenceTypes` field on `Attribute` to restrict available reference choices for `REFERENCE` and `SINGLE_REFERENCE` attributes:
  - For `PRODUCT`/`PRODUCT_VARIANT` entity types: Accepts list of `ProductType` IDs to limit selectable products/variants to those types.
  - For `PAGE` entity type: Accepts list of `PageType` IDs (now shown as "Model types") to limit selectable models (previously pages) to those types.
  - When not specified, all objects of the entity type are available.
  - Can be set via `attributeCreate`, `attributeUpdate`, `attributeBulkCreate`, and `attributeBulkUpdate` mutations.
- Added `RefundSettings` for configuring required refund reasons globally. You can now require staff to provide structured refund reasons using any custom Model type (PageType in API):
  - Use `refundSettingsUpdate` mutation to set a `PageType` as the reason reference type. Create Models of this type representing your refund reasons (e.g., "Defective Product", "Wrong Item Shipped")
  - Once configured, staff users must provide a `reasonReference` (Page ID of that type) when creating refunds via `orderGrantRefundCreate`, `orderGrantRefundUpdate`, `orderRefund`, `fulfillmentRefundProducts`, and `transactionRequestAction` mutations
  - Use `refundReasonReferenceTypeClear` mutation to disable the requirement
  - Apps are not required to provide reasons, only staff users
  - This allows you to standardize and track refund reasons across your organization

#### Enhanced Filtering & Search

- You can now filter and search orders using the new `where` and `search` fields on the `orders` query.
  - The `where` argument supports `AND`/`OR` logic and explicit operators (`eq`, `oneOf`, `range`) for all fields.
  - Existing `filter` fields remain available in `where`: `ids`, `channels` (now `channel_id`), `customer`, `created` (now `created_at`), `updated_at`, `status`, `authorize_status`, `charge_status`, `payment_status`, `is_click_and_collect`, `is_preorder`, `checkout_tokens` (now `checkout_token`), `checkout_ids` (now `checkout_id`), `gift_card_used` (now `is_gift_card_used`), `gift_card_bought` (now `is_gift_card_bought`), `numbers` (now `number`), `metadata`.
  - New filtering options available only in `where`:
    - `user` - Filter by user ID.
    - `user_email` - Filter by user email.
    - `voucher_code` - Filter by voucher code used in the order.
    - `has_invoices` - Filter by whether the order has any invoices.

    - `lines` - Filter by line item data (metadata, product details, quantities).
    - `lines_count` - Filter by number of lines in the order.
    - `transactions` - Filter by transaction data (payment method name and type, metadata). Note: Payment method filtering only works for transactions created after upgrading to this release: [see docs](https://docs.saleor.io/developer/payments/transactions#storing-payment-method-details).
    - `total_gross` - Filter by total gross amount.
    - `total_net` - Filter by total net amount.

    - `lines_count` - Filter by number of lines in the draft order.
    - `transactions` - Filter by transaction data (payment method name and type, metadata). Note: Payment method filtering only works for transactions created after upgrading to this release: [see docs](https://docs.saleor.io/developer/payments/transactions#via-transaction-mutations).
    - `total_gross` - Filter by total gross amount.
    - `total_net` - Filter by total net amount.

  - Note that compared to `orders`, draft orders do not support filtering by: `status`, `checkout_token`, `checkout_id`, `is_gift_card_used`, `is_gift_card_bought`, `has_invoices`, `invoices`, `has_fulfillments`, `fulfillments`.
  - Use `search` to perform full-text search across relevant fields, it works the same as `orders` search (see above).
- You can now filter and search customers using the new `where` and `search` fields on the `customers` query.
  - Use `where` to define complex conditions with `AND`/`OR` logic and operators like `eq`, `oneOf`, `range`. It also adds new filtering options for customers:
    - Filter by email address.
    - Filter by first and last name.
    - Filter by active status (`isActive`).
    - Filter by phone numbers and country of associated user addresses.
    - Filter by phone numbers associated with user addresses.

    - Customer's email address, first name, last name
    - Addresses in customer address book: first name, last name, street, city, postal code, country (code and name), phone
- Filtering products by `category` now also includes subcategories. The filter will return products that belong to the specified categories as well as their subcategories.

#### Payments & Transactions

- Added support for payment method details in the Transaction API. Data about payment like card details, method name, and type can now be stored directly on `TransactionItem` and accessed via the `TransactionItem.paymentMethodDetails` field.
  - Two payment method types are currently supported:
    - `CARD` - For card payments, fields that can be stored: name, brand, first/last 4 digits, expiration month/year
    - `OTHER` - For non-card payments, field that can be stored: payment method name (e.g., "Wire Transfer")
  - Payment method details can be provided by apps in two ways:
    - Via Transaction mutations: `transactionEventReport`, `transactionCreate`, `transactionUpdate`
    - Via Transaction webhooks: `TRANSACTION_INITIALIZE_SESSION`, `TRANSACTION_PROCESS_SESSION` (see [Transaction webhooks docs](https://docs.saleor.io/developer/extending/webhooks/synchronous-events/transaction#response-4))
  - Previously, payment apps often stored this information in transaction's `metadata` in an unstructured format defined by each app. This limited interoperability and search. With structured payment method details, this information is now standardized across all apps, which makes it type-safe and easily accessible for custom integrations and allows search on `orders` and `draftOrders` queries.
  - For more details for implementing this change in apps [see Storing payment method details docs](https://docs.saleor.io/developer/payments/transactions#storing-payment-method-details)
- Added `fractionalAmount` and `fractionDigits` fields to the `Money` type:
  - `fractionalAmount` - amount as an integer in the smallest currency unit (e.g., `1295` for $12.95 USD, `1234` for ¥1234 JPY)
  - `fractionDigits` - number of decimal places for the currency (e.g., `2` for USD, `0` for JPY)
  - Useful for payment integrations requiring integers and avoiding floating-point precision issues when doing arithmetic operations

### Webhooks

- Transaction webhooks (`TRANSACTION_INITIALIZE_SESSION`, `TRANSACTION_PROCESS_SESSION`) can now return `paymentMethodDetails` in their response, which will be stored on the corresponding `TransactionItem`. This allows payment apps to provide payment method information (card details, payment method name, etc.) during transaction processing. See the [Transaction API](#graphql-api) section above for more details about payment method details, and [webhook response format docs](https://docs.saleor.io/developer/extending/webhooks/synchronous-events/transaction#response-4) for implementation details.

### App Extensions

- Added new `AppExtensionTargetEnum.NEW_TAB` target. Extensions with this target open URLs in a new browser tab when triggered from Dashboard actions. Supports both GET and POST methods via `options.newTabTarget.method`. Use with `*_OVERVIEW_CREATE`, `*_OVERVIEW_MORE_ACTIONS`, and `*_DETAILS_MORE_ACTIONS` mount points.
- Added new `AppExtensionTargetEnum.WIDGET` target. Extensions with this target render as embedded iframes on Dashboard pages, allowing apps to display custom UI and interactive content. Supports both GET and POST methods via `options.widgetTarget.method`. Use with `*_DETAILS_WIDGETS` mount points.
- Added new `AppExtensionMountEnum` values for expanded mount points across Dashboard:
  - **List pages** (action mount points for `NEW_TAB`, `APP_PAGE`, or `POPUP` target extensions):
    - Categories: `CATEGORY_OVERVIEW_CREATE`, `CATEGORY_OVERVIEW_MORE_ACTIONS`
    - Collections: `COLLECTION_OVERVIEW_CREATE`, `COLLECTION_OVERVIEW_MORE_ACTIONS`
    - Gift Cards: `GIFT_CARD_OVERVIEW_CREATE`, `GIFT_CARD_OVERVIEW_MORE_ACTIONS`
    - Draft Orders: `DRAFT_ORDER_OVERVIEW_CREATE`, `DRAFT_ORDER_OVERVIEW_MORE_ACTIONS`

    - Menus: `MENU_OVERVIEW_CREATE`, `MENU_OVERVIEW_MORE_ACTIONS`
  - **Detail pages**:
    - Action mount points (for `NEW_TAB`, `APP_PAGE`, or `POPUP` target extensions):
      - Categories: `CATEGORY_DETAILS_MORE_ACTIONS`
      - Collections: `COLLECTION_DETAILS_MORE_ACTIONS`
      - Gift Cards: `GIFT_CARD_DETAILS_MORE_ACTIONS`
      - Draft Orders: `DRAFT_ORDER_DETAILS_MORE_ACTIONS`
      - Discounts: `DISCOUNT_DETAILS_MORE_ACTIONS`
      - Vouchers: `VOUCHER_DETAILS_MORE_ACTIONS`
      - Models (Pages): `PAGE_DETAILS_MORE_ACTIONS`
      - Model Types (Page Types): `PAGE_TYPE_DETAILS_MORE_ACTIONS`
      - Menus: `MENU_DETAILS_MORE_ACTIONS`
      - Products: `PRODUCT_DETAILS_MORE_ACTIONS`
      - Customers: `CUSTOMER_DETAILS_MORE_ACTIONS`
      - Orders: `ORDER_DETAILS_MORE_ACTIONS`
    - Widget mount points (for `WIDGET` target extensions only):
      - Collections: `COLLECTION_DETAILS_WIDGETS`
      - Gift Cards: `GIFT_CARD_DETAILS_WIDGETS`
      - Draft Orders: `DRAFT_ORDER_DETAILS_WIDGETS`
      - Vouchers: `VOUCHER_DETAILS_WIDGETS`
      - Products: `PRODUCT_DETAILS_WIDGETS`
      - Customers: `CUSTOMER_DETAILS_WIDGETS`
      - Orders: `ORDER_DETAILS_WIDGETS`
- Added `options` field to `AppExtension` type. For `NEW_TAB` target, returns `AppExtensionOptionsNewTab` with `newTabTarget.method` field. For `WIDGET` target, returns `AppExtensionOptionsWidget` with `widgetTarget.method` field. Both support `HttpMethod.GET` and `HttpMethod.POST`.
- See [App Extensions documentation](https://docs.saleor.io/developer/extending/apps/extending-dashboard-with-apps) for more details on how to implement these new features in apps

### JSON Schemas

- Add JSON schemas for synchronous webhooks, now available in `saleor/json_schemas.py`. These schemas define the expected structure of webhook responses sent back to Saleor, enabling improved validation and tooling support for integrations. This change helps ensure that responses from webhook consumers meet Saleor's expectations and can be reliably processed.

### Other changes

- deps: upgraded urllib3 from v1.x to v2.x
- Fix PAGE_DELETE webhook to include pageType in payload - #17697 by @Jennyyyy0212 and @CherineCho2016
- Changed logging settings of failed requests to reduce logs amount in production:

  - Downgraded the "A query had an error" log from INFO to DEBUG level.
  - Increased the `django.request` logger's level to ERROR, to reduce the number of WARNING logs for failed GraphQL or 404 requests.

  Previously, a failed GraphQL request (up to Saleor 3.21) would generate the following logs:

  ```
  2025-06-06 13:26:06,104 INFO saleor.graphql.errors.handled A query had an error [PID:21676:ThreadPoolExecutor-5_0]
  2025-06-06 13:26:06,107 WARNING django.request Bad Request: /graphql/ [PID:21676:ThreadPoolExecutor-6_0]
  INFO:     127.0.0.1:63244 - "POST /graphql/ HTTP/1.1" 400 Bad Request
  ```

  Starting from Saleor 3.22, the same request logs only the HTTP-level message:

  ```
  INFO:     127.0.0.1:63345 - "POST /graphql/ HTTP/1.1" 400 Bad Request
  ```

  To see details of why a GraphQL request is failing, you can use OpenTelemetry tracing, where each span for a failing request will be marked with an error flag and will include an error message.

- Fixed bug when not-authenticated staff user couldn't fetch `appExtension.app` without `MANAGE_APPS`. Now apps access is available by staff users and the app itself (for app and extension it owns)
- Fixed bug in user email filtering to make it case-insensitive.
- Checkouts having total gross amount equal to 0 will get their authorization statuses updated to `CheckoutAuthorizeStatus.FULL` upon fetching checkout data.
- Fixed a bug that could prevent rich text attributes written in scripts using combining diacritical marks (for example, Arabic) from being saved properly.
- Fixed a bug where a Checkout partially paid by Transaction(s) and partially paid by Gift Card(s) could not be completed due to `CHECKOUT_NOT_FULLY_PAID` error. Checkout authorize and charge statuses are now recalculated more reliably. Status calculation is now taking into account available gift cards balance.

### Deprecations

- Deprecated the `filter` argument in favor of the new `where` and `search` arguments.
  The `where` argument introduces more flexible filtering, allowing complex conditions using `AND`/`OR` logic and operators such as `eq`, `oneOf`, and `range`.
  The `filter` argument has been deprecated in the following queries:
  - `attributes`
  - `customers`
  - `products`
  - `productVariants`
  - `orders`
  - `draftOrders`
  - `productType.availableAttributes`
  - `category.products`
  - `collection.products`
  - `pageType.availableAttributes`
- Deprecated `Transaction.gatewayResponse` field. Please migrate to Transaction API and Apps.
- Deprecated `attribute` and `attributes` fields on Page, Product, and ProductVariant. Use the `AssignedAttribute` interface instead.
- Stripe Plugin has been deprecated. It will be removed in the future. Please use [the Stripe App](https://docs.saleor.io/developer/app-store/apps/stripe/overview) instead

Following plugins are now marked as deprecated:
