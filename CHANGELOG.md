# 3.24.0 [Unreleased]

### Breaking changes

- Removed the deprecated Authorize.Net payment gateway plugin (`mirumee.payments.authorize_net`).
- Apps will be no longer to be granted with `MANAGE_APPS` permission. In certain cases, this permission was able to be assigned by the authorized user.
  App with such permission was not able to *act* like an admin app, but permission technically was granted.

  From Saleor 3.24, this app installation with `MANAGE_APPS` permission will be rejected.
  To safely upgrade, ensure that all installed apps do not have this permission.
