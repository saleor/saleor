# 3.22.0 [Unreleased]

### Breaking changes

### GraphQL API
- Added support for filtering products by attribute value names. The `AttributeInput` now includes a `valueNames` field, enabling filtering by the names of attribute values, in addition to the existing filtering by value slugs.
- You can now filter and search orders using the new `where` and `search` fields on the `orders` query.
  - Use `where` to define complex conditions with `AND`/`OR` logic and operators like `eq`, `oneOf`, `range`.
  - Use `search` to perform full-text search across relevant fields.
  - Added filtering options for orders:
    - Filter by voucher codes.
    - Filter by invoice existence.
    - Filter by associated invoice creation date.
    - Filter by fulfillment existence.
    - Filter by associated fulfillment status.
    - Filter by number of lines in the order.
- Extend the `Page` type with an `attribute` field. Adds support for querying a specific attribute on a page by `slug`, returning the matching attribute and its assigned values, or null if no match is found.

### Webhooks

### Other changes
- Add JSON schemas for synchronous webhooks, now available in `saleor/json_schemas.py`. These schemas define the expected structure of webhook payloads, enabling improved validation and tooling support for webhook integrations. This change helps ensure that webhook consumers can reliably parse and validate incoming data.
