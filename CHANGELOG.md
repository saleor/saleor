# 3.20.0

### Highlights

- Connecting the Transaction item to a granted refund in the refund flow is now possible. This makes it easier to understand what’s the status of a refund. - #15590 by @korycins

### Breaking changes

- **Feature preview breaking change**:

  - Improve support for handling transactions - #10350 by @korycins
    - For all new `transactionItem` created by `transactionCreate`, any update action can be done only by the same app/user that performed `transactionCreate` action. This change impacts only on new `transactionItem,` the already existing will work in the same way as previously.
    - `transactionRequestAction` mutation can't be executed with `MANAGE_ORDERS` permission. Permission `HANDLE_PAYMENTS` is required.
    - Drop calling `TRANSACTION_ACTION_REQUEST` webhook inside a mutation related to `Payment` types. The related mutations: `orderVoid`, `orderCapture`, `orderRefund`, `orderFulfillmentRefundProducts`, `orderFulfillmentReturnProducts`. Use a dedicated mutation for triggering an action: `transactionRequestAction`.

  See the [3.12 to 3.13](https://docs.saleor.io/docs/3.x/upgrade-guides/3-12-to-3-13) upgrade guide for more details.

        {
          ...
        }
      ]
     }
  ```

  ```
     {

- Change the discount rounding mode - #12041 by @IKarbowiak

  - Change the rounding mode from `ROUND_DOWN` to `ROUND_HALF_UP` - it affects the discount amount and total price of future checkouts and orders with a percentage discount applied.

    E.g. if you had an order for $13 and applied a 12.5% discount, you would get $11.38 with a $1.62 discount, but now it will be calculated as $11.37 with $1.63 discount.
