# 3.21.0 [Unreleased]

### Highlights
- Introduced a configurable customer address strategy, allowing control over whether shipping or billing addresses are saved in the customer’s address book - #17364 by @IKarbowiak
	- Applies when a checkout or draft order is completed for a logged-in user.
	- Default behavior remains unchanged: addresses are saved for checkouts but not for draft orders.
	- The new save address setting is available in:
      - `checkoutCreate`
      - `checkoutShippingAddressUpdate`
      - `checkoutBillingAddressUpdate`
      - `draftOrderCreate`
      - `draftOrderUpdate`
	- The flag must be provided as part of an address; otherwise, an error is raised.
	- Does not apply to Click & Collect delivery methods — shipping address is not saved in such case.
