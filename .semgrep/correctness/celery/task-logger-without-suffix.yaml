      Wrapping the module's logger with Celery can lead to unexpected behaviors when called outside Celery, such as crashes or missing custom logging formatters (e.g., HTTP request log formatter).
      Because of that, the task logger should be using its own specific namespace, such as f"{__name__}.celery".
