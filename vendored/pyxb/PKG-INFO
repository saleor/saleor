Description: PyXB is a pure `Python <http://www.python.org>`_ package that generates
        Python code for classes that correspond to data structures defined by
        `XMLSchema <http://www.w3.org/XML/Schema>`_.  In concept it is similar to
        `JAXB <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAXB>`_ for Java and `CodeSynthesis XSD
        <http://www.codesynthesis.com/products/xsd/>`_ for C++.
        
        The major goals of PyXB are:
        
        * Provide a generated Python interface that is "Pythonic", meaning similar
          to one that would have been hand-written:
        
          + Attributes and elements are Python properties, with name conflicts
            resolved in favor of elements
          + Elements with maxOccurs larger than 1 are stored as Python lists
          + Bindings for type extensions inherit from the binding for the base type
          + Enumeration constraints are exposed as class (constant) variables
        
        * Support bi-directional conversion (document to Python and back)
        
        * Allow easy customization of the generated bindings to provide
          functionality along with content
        
        * Support all XMLSchema features that are in common use, including:
        
          + complex content models (nested all/choice/sequence)
          + cross-namespace dependencies
          + include and import directives
          + constraints on simple types
